Has anyone employed at a dot com NOT written a variant of this script?

Given a stock ticker symbol, scrape the current price from
Yahoo/Google and figure out how much money you'd walk away from if you
quit.

This works quite well for the restricted stock units granted by my
current employer. You simply need to configure the number of shares
currently held, and your vesting schedule.

Usage:
  worth.pl --ticker=[ticker symbol] (--value=x.xx)
